# Fixes for BASSCSS

This fixes some things I couldn't get through to @jxnblk but found useful in day-to-day work.

```
bower install basscss-fix
```

or Rails project:

```ruby
# Gemfile
source 'https://rails-assets.org' do
  gem 'rails-assets-basscss-fix'
end
```

```sass
// application.sass
@import basscss-fix
```

## TODO
* More partials
* More docs
